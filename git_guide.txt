# Git Guide: When to Use `git clone` vs `git init`

## 1. Use `git clone` when:
- The repository **already exists** on GitHub or another remote hosting platform.
- The repository contains files like `README.md`, `LICENSE`, or any other files created through GitHub's interface.

### Steps for Cloning and Adding Files:
1. **Clone the repository:**
   When you clone a repository, Git automatically initializes it for you. The command is:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/username/repo-name.git
   ```
   This creates a local copy of the remote repository and sets it up for you.

2. **Navigate to the cloned repository:**
   ```
   cd repo-name
   ```

3. **Move or add your files into the cloned repository:**
   ```
   mv ~/Desktop/my-files/* .
   ```

4. **Stage the changes:**
   ```
   git add .
   ```

5. **Commit the changes:**
   ```
   git commit -m "Added my files"
   ```

6. **Push the changes to the remote repository:**
   ```
   git push origin main
   ```

## 2. Use `git init` when:
- You are **starting from scratch** and the GitHub repository is either empty or doesn't exist yet.
- You don't have any files like `README.md` or `LICENSE` already set up in the remote repository.

### Steps for Initializing a New Repository:
1. **Create a project directory (if it doesn't exist) and navigate to it:**
   ```
   mkdir my-new-project
   cd my-new-project
   ```

2. **Initialize a new Git repository:**
   ```
   git init
   ```

3. **Add a remote link to your GitHub repository:**
   ```
   git remote add origin https://github.com/username/repo-name.git
   ```

4. **Stage your files:**
   ```
   git add .
   ```

5. **Commit the changes:**
   ```
   git commit -m "Initial commit"
   ```

6. **Push the changes to the remote repository:**
   ```
   git push -u origin main
   ```

## Practical Rule:
- **Use `git clone`** when the repo on GitHub already contains files (like `README.md` or `LICENSE`).
- **Use `git init`** when you are creating a repo from scratch and need to initialize Git yourself.

## Notes:
- If you run `git init` on a repository that already contains files on GitHub, you will need to pull the changes first (using `git pull origin main --rebase`) to avoid conflicts when pushing.

** IF you have no folder already on your local and want all the files from repo :
    Git clone <url> (folder name will be name of repo -> http://ww../node-1 => folder name = node-1
   **Else do Git clone <url> folder-name
